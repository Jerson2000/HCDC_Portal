# HCDC Student Portal for android 
I started working on this project in mid-December, as I was feeling bored and there wasn't much to do at home. Since the student portal could not handle too many requests, I came up with the idea of creating an Android app for the HCDC student portal that would allow users to view their subjects and accountabilities offline and to lessen unnecessary request just to view there schedules. [ still buggy and it needs more cleaner code o((>Ï‰< ))o ]

> Only the Holy Cross of Davao College Student/s are able to use this app.
